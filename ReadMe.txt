To run the project, open the terminal and change your directory to the directory where the code is stored and run the following command:
gcc image.c -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lIL
If no errors are displayed, execute the command:
./a.out
(* Make sure that all the required libraries are present in the computer)
This shows the start screen with the project title, the student names and the guides names along with an image of our College logo.
Follow instructions on the screen to proceed to the project.


To run the simulation separately, use the command:
g++ goalline.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL 
If no errors are displayed, execute the command:
./a.out
This directly shows the simulation of Goal-Line Technology and skips the startscreen part.
